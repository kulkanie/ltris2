- no tooltip if using keys in menu

Changes to make ltris1 core work:
- disable all SDL.h includes, except in sdl.h: change SDL.h include to SDL2.h
- define compat macros:
	#define SDLK_LAST SDL_NUM_SCANCODES
	#define SDL_FULLSCREEN 0
	#define SDL_SRCCOLORKEY 0
	#define SDL_NOEVENT 0
	#define SDL_GetKeyState SDL_GetKeyboardState
- empty all functions in sdl.c but create dummy surfaces and dummy font to
  allow access of w and h attributes
- rename Font to OldFont
- turn ALIGN_X_LEFT,... into macros and only set if not yet defined 
- disable bowl_quick_game() in bowls.h
- add ViewBowlInfo and set sounds and cleared lines
- set full bowl content to vbi on game over
